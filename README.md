# MonitoringProject
This study investigates indoor occupancy monitoring through the use of non-invasive sensors such as CO2, temperature, and lighting, supported by Machine Learning techniques. The analysis focuses on optimizing the energy efficiency of indoor spaces. After a thorough preliminary analysis of the environmental data, clustering algorithms are used to identify patterns, and classification algorithms are employed to estimate the number of occupants. The results show that the K-means algorithm demonstrates excellent clustering capabilities, while Neural Networks exhibit superior performance in classification tasks. The evaluation was conducted considering both the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods employed.
